# Introduction
Handy Signs is a visual communications protocol which uses hand signals. The hand signals are static and designed to transmit efficiently over video making it useful for video conferencing. Handy signs can also be utilised for group meetings, presentations, and speeches.

# Purpose
* Being efficient in video conference call setup
* Improving audio quality over video conferencing
* Gathering group consensus
* Ability to signal about necessary adjustments for the video conference (eg: disruptive background noise that needs to be muted) without stopping the flow of the meeting.

# Usage
The transmitting node holds the signal in view of the receiving node. If the case of video conferencing, ensure the signal is in view of the camera. The signal is held by the sending node until acknowledged by the receiving node.

# Signals
## What is my audio quality?
### Usage
Determine how audio is being received by the other nodes.

### Gesture
* Back of hand facing camera.
* Fingers spread.
* Response

## Signal audio quality.
Your audio quality is (0-5).

### Usage
Rate received audio quality on scale from zero (nothing heard) to five (loud and clear).
