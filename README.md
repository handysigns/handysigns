# Introduction
Handy Signs is a visual communications protocol which uses hand signals. The hand signals are static and designed to transmit efficiently over video making it useful for video conferencing. Handy signs can also be utilised for group meetings, presentations, and speeches.

# Purpose
* Being efficient in video conference call setup
* Improving audio quality over video conferencing
